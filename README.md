# Academic Homepage (Mayday 25th Anniversary Theme)

This is an academic personal homepage template based on the color scheme of Mayday's 25th Anniversary. The page is built with simple HTML and CSS, requiring no complex build tools, making it easy to modify and deploy.

## 🎨 Visual Design

- **Color Palette**: Uses Mayday's classic five-color dots (Yellow, Orange, Pink, Blue, Green) plus Watermelon Red.
- **Elements**:
  - The five "dots" at the top represent the five members of Mayday, with simple CSS geometric shapes (sunglasses, eyes, etc.).
  - The "fruit" elements at the bottom echo the fresh and lively cartoon style.
  - **Fonts**: Google Fonts `Inter` (Body) and `Patrick Hand` (Handwritten Title) are used to create an academic yet lively atmosphere.
